# Neurovisual Control Celeste

This project consisted of exploring the application of a neurovisual control to the 
Celeste digital game environment. Challenges were faced related to the 
Digital Image Processing of the frames and the integration of an 
Artificial Intelligence for decision making and execution of the actions of the Madeline character (playable character).
